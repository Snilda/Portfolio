# My Role and Process: Design System Lead

My core responsibility was the effective management, development and evolving of the company's design system. My work was focused on creating a solid foundation, developing new components and standards, design processes and assisting teams in utilizing the design system.

# Design
There was no single design standard existed in BCS. Teams used various libraries, guidelines and styles. This increased development costs and slowed time-to-market. We needed single source of truth, so we did it.
### Definition of Core Components
During development of the design system, its architecture was carefully structured, and the following essential libraries were established, which form the basis of all products:

**Tokens**  
Foundation of the visual style:

- Spacings
- Shadows
- Roundings
- Colors: Primary, Special
- Typography: Web, iOS, Android
- Animation: Curve, Duration

**Components & Documentation**  
Reusable elements and modules for all products:

- Basic components
- Basic animations
- Templates
- Product-specific components:
